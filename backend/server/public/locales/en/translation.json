In order to shine a light on political advertising on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/help-us-monitor-political-ads-online\">ProPublica built a tool</a> that allows Facebook users to automatically send us the political ads that they see in their News Feeds. Use this tool to view the Facebook political ads we’ve collected so far. You can read about how this works in our <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-are-monitoring-political-ads-on-facebook\">methodology</a>.</p><p><br />Facebook launched its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/politicalcontentads\">own database of political ads</a>, but it’s missing plenty of ads. And it doesn't include each ad's targeting details, which are important for understanding campaign tactics. <a href=\"#which-ads\">Which ads do we show here?</a></p><p><br />If you’d like to contribute ads, please download our software for <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-ad-collector/\">Firefox</a> or <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-political-ad-col/enliecaalhkhhihcmnbjfmmjkljlcinl\">Chrome</a> web browsers.</p>",
  "whichads": "<h3>What Makes an Ad a “Political Ad”?</h3><p><br />In our Facebook Political Ad project, our aim is to include all of the unambiguously political ads we find, and to exclude all the ads that are unambiguously non-political. But we also include some ads where the political nature is less certain.</p><p><br />Ads from politicians running for office and interest groups advocating a specific policy are clearly political, so we aim to include as many of these ads in the Political Ad Collector as possible.  We include some other ads that don’t fit into the first category but that discuss political issues, or that come from organizations that have previously run ads that are in our database, even if the newer ads themselves do not mention political issues.</p><p><br />We rely on a software algorithm to detect likely political content and we also rely on participants' intuitive sense of what's political to \"train\" our software. As such, we are in a way defining what counts as a political ad together with the community of participants in our project.</p><p><br />However, the presence of an ad from an organization in this list doesn’t mean that we categorically think an organization is attempting to influence the outcome of an election or explicitly expressing a specific policy preference.</p><p><br />If you see an ad in the Facebook Political Ad Collector that you think we categorized incorrectly, don’t hesitate to let us know at <a href=\"mailto:politicalads@propublica.org\">politicalads@propublica.org</a>.<p>",
