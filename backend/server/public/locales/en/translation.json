In order to shine a light on political advertising on Facebook, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/help-us-monitor-political-ads-online\">ProPublica built a tool</a> that allows Facebook users to automatically send us the political ads that they see in their News Feeds. Use this tool to view the Facebook political ads we’ve collected so far.You can read about how this works in our <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-are-monitoring-political-ads-on-facebook\">methodology</a>.</p><p><br />Facebook launched its <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/politicalcontentads\">own database of political ads</a>, but it’s missing plenty of ads. And it doesn't include each ad's targeting details, which are important for understanding campaign tactics.</p><p><br />If you’d like to contribute ads, please download our software for <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-ad-collector/\">Firefox</a> or <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-political-ad-col/enliecaalhkhhihcmnbjfmmjkljlcinl\">Chrome</a> web browsers.</p>",
